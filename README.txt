Specific Requirements

● Create a class LeapYearCalculator that creates a new leap year calculator
● This calculator does not need to store anything, but you should be able to call two methods on
it: isLeapYear(int year) and displayCalendar(year)
● The method isLeapYear should take in a year (assume positive only) and print out whether it is
a leap year or not as per the rules above
● The method displayCalandar should take in a year and print out a calendar to the screen. This
calendar does not need to show the days of the week, just the dates in the month, each 7 days
on a new line (see samples at the end of the document)
● In addition to this, create a second file that allows us to test the calculator. This should contain
your main method and make a call to the isLeapYear method and the displayCalandar method
